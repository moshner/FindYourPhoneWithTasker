# Find Your Phone With Tasker

![Icon for project][icon-phone-search]

**Problem**: I frequently misplace my phone and have no phone with which to call it.

**Solution**: Trigger a sound effect on the phone remotely from my watch, email, or web browser.

Overview
--------

The trick here is to make sure that we can locate the phone _even if it is muted_. So the first thing we do is create a task that turns all your volumes up, plays and endless loop of music, and pop's up a message to end the music as soon as it is found. After that we need to think about the best way to trigger this feature. There a many ways to trigger it but we are going to cover three here:
1) From your Pebble watch, 2) From an email to yourself, 3) From a web browser using Join by joaoapps.
